            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am Tracie Ca√±as Tomon. Currently in my second year of pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, with a specialization in Mobile and Internet Technology. People call me Trace, Tres or Trai. Some of my relatives call me Budang, like the Buddha, because I looked like the Buddha when I was born. Any shade of blue is my fave color. I like keeping things neat and tidy. Depending on my mood, I can be a bit of an introvert or an extrovert. I am committed to becoming a skilled IT professional, driven by my passion for technology and continuous learning.</p>
